# Portfolio


The Portfolio project was created for the needs of learning and self-development in the field of HTML and CSS.
The motivation to create the project is also participation in CodersCamp workshops.
The Portfolio project is a business card presenting my person.

In the portfolio design, I used the semantics introduced in HTML5 to clearly define the page.

The Portfolio project includes ;
Header with a navigation part,
next is the main part,
finally a footer containing contact information

To get a responsive website, properly scaled at different resolutions, I used Flexbox.

portfolio.css file includes the styling of individual elements to maintain a consistent composition.
